# TextToVideo

Based on Microsoft Azure cognitive APIs, our software can generate a video based on
users' pure text input. By analyzing the key phrases and words in the text, our software
will find the most matching pictures online with Bing search API, and then generate
a video composed of these pictures. The software aims to help children, people have
reading disorder and undereducated people to better understanding the text and raise
their further interest in reading and learning.
